Week 5 Homework Submission File: Archiving and Logging Data

Please edit this file by adding the solution commands on the line below the prompt.
Save and submit the completed file for your homework submission.


Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives


Command to extract the TarDocs.tar archive to the current directory: tar -xvf TarDocs.tar to extract the file to the current directory.
 

Command to create the Javaless_Doc.tar archive from the TarDocs/ directory, while excluding the TarDocs/Documents/Java directory: tar –cvf javaless_doc.tar --remove ~/Projects/TarDocs/Documents/Java TarDocs


Command to ensure Java/ is not in the new Javaless_Docs.tar archive: tar –xf javaless_doc.tar | grep java. Nothing comes up cause no java.


Bonus

Command to create an incremental archive called logs_backup_tar.gz with only changed files to snapshot.file for the /var/log directory: tar cvvWf logs.backup.tar.gz –listed-incremental=snapshot.file.snar


Critical Analysis Question

Why wouldn't you use the options -x and -c at the same with tar? Options "-x" and "-c" are operations. Only one operation argument can be given at a time, so you wouldnt run more than one per command.



Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

Cron job for backing up the /var/log/auth.log file:
 



Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts


Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories: :~$ mkdir -p ~/backups/{freemen,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}/{freemen,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}

 


Paste your system.sh script edits below:
#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Memory Info:" > ~/backups/freemen/freemen.txt
free > ~/backups/freemen/freemen.txt
echo -e "\nDisk Usage:" > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
du -H | head -2 >> ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
lsof > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt
 


Command to make the system.sh script executable: CTRL+X + CTRL+Y. 


Optional

Commands to test the script and confirm its execution: sudo bash system.sh

Bonus

Command to copy system to system-wide cron directory:



Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes


Run sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf to edit the logrotate configuration file.
Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the /var/log/auth.log.

Add your config file edits below:
# see "man logrotate" for details
# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# use the syslog group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
su root syslog

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 7
notifempty

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
delaycompress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# no packages own wtmp, or btmp -- we'll rotate them here
/var/log/wtmp {
    missingok
    monthly
    create 0664 root utmp
    rotate 1
}

Command using auditd to set rules for /etc/shadow, /etc/passwd and /var/log/auth.log:

Add the edits made to the rules file below:

[Your solution edits here]


Command to restart auditd:


Command to list all auditd rules:


Command to produce an audit report:


Create a user with sudo useradd attacker and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques


Command to return journalctl messages with priorities from emergency to error:


Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:


Command to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt:
